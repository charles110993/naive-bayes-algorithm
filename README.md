# naive-bayes-algorithm
These are the implementations of the Naive Bayes algorithms from scratch. we can use these classes to fit  training data and make predictions on the test data. 
To preprocess the data, we may need to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, or normalize numerical features. 
we can use pandas and numpy functions for such preprocessing tasks.
For visualization, we can use the matplotlib library to create plots of your data, such as scatter plots or histograms, to understand the distribution and 
relationships between variables
